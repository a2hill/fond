# Grain-Free Tahini Granola
### If you’re missing the oats in this gluten-free, make-ahead granola, simply swap out 1 cup of the nuts for ¾ cup rolled oats (Bob’s Red Mill makes a variety of gluten-free oats that are perfect for this recipe).

* Yield: Makes about 6 cups
## Ingredients 
* 3 cups mixed raw nuts, such as pistachios, pecans, walnuts, and/or almonds
* 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
* ¼ cup pure maple syrup
* ¼ cup tahini
* 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 1¼  tsp. kosher salt
* ½ tsp. ground cardamom or cinnamon
## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Toss nuts and coconut in a large bowl. Whisk maple syrup, tahini, oil, salt, and cardamom in a medium bowl until combined. Pour tahini syrup over nut mixture and toss with a spatula until evenly coated. Scrape onto prepared sheet. Bake granola, tossing and rotating sheet from front to back every 10–15 minutes, until golden brown, 30–35 minutes total.
2. Let cool on baking sheet (granola will crisp as it cools), about 20 minutes. Break into pieces before serving.
3. Do Ahead: Granola can be made 2 weeks ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
